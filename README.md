# Compressed Machines (WIP)
_What does it do?_

Compressed Machines is an addon for Slimefun that adds compressed variants of electric machines such as gold pans, smelteries and dust washers, that can process up to eight items at a time. This is my proposed solution to the enourmous amount of processing power that Slimefun cargo networks take to run; instead of having many nodes connected to many machines that process one item at a time, you now only need to have a few machines that process multiple items.


_How does it work?_

Compressed machines can be crafted in an Enhanced Crafting Table using either four or eight instances of the original machine - for example, eight `Gold Pan III`s would be needed to create an `8x Compressed Gold Pan`. The compressed variants can be crafted back into normal machines by placing them in the first slot of an Enhanced Crafting Table.
